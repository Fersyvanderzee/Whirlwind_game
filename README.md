# Whirlwind_game

A whirlwind game for the Raspberry Pi. The idea is the same as the cyclone games on the fair, but this one is for 2 players. Still in the making. Both players have a green LED on their side and the LED that is on keeps bouncing between the players. Whenever a player pushes his or her button at the same time his or her green LED is on, that player scores a point.

I still need to include the following:

- score/count system
- get a case and rewire
